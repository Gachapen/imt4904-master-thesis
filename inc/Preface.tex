\chapter*{Preface}
This is a Master's thesis in Applied Computer Science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology that was carried out during the spring semester of 2017.

It is based on an idea of a virtual world where people can create and experience a garden by growing a wide variety of random generated plants that may be recognizable or unexpected, but allways aesthetically pleasing.
They can then crossbreed these plants into new surprising plants that have distinct features from both of the parent plants, letting the user's creativity go wild.

The reader of this thesis will benefit of a general knowledge in computer science and computer programming.
Additional knowledge in evolutionary computing will be helpful, but not strictly necessary.
